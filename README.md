# BikeBuddy
-The app uses the citibike API https://api.citybik.es/v2/ to get realtime data about the citibike outlets.<br />
-The app shows the Citi Bike locations in NY city on a google map from the current location which is hard coded to New York city coordinates.<br />
-The maps on launch shows only locations within 1 mile range from current user location.<br />
-The user can increase or decrease the search range using the seek bar.<br />
-The markers on the map when clicked show information about the Citibike Location Name, Free Bikes and Empty slots availability.<br />
-If the Free bikes or Empty slots availability is less than 2 the marker is displayed in lighter color otherwise in a brighter color.<br />
